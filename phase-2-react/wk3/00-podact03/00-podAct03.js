/**
 * Goals:
 - Create a React app that a user can add new coffees to our state using forms and adding the new coffee to the container
  1. Assign state to the correct components (May need to change type of components from func to class)
  2. Create the form for a new coffee (name, size)
  3. Assign event handlers where needed

  Stretch:
  Adding react-router for the `new` form and redirecting to the `coffee-container` page
